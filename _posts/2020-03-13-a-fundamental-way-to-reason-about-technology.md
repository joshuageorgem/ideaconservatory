> Architecture. 

Chances were, that the first image that came into your mind after reading that word, was that of a building. Another fun fact – pieces of code, of instructions that make up software are called ‘Builds’! Developers, Routes, Storage, Architects, Stacks, the more you understand the glossary of the digital world you soon realize, that despite being so abstract – it is actually a mirror of our physical world.

> Being human in the digital world is about building a digital world for humans. - Andrew Keen

Modern research in physics, has revealed that underneath the quantum level lies another level, a level from which space and time (physical reality) both emerge (the wavefunction) - and that is  at the level of ‘information’. Perhaps this is why the dawn of the information age, propelled our world to exponential heights. 


So here is the question, ‘what made it so transformational?’ A clue to begin the search for this answer, lies in what happened when humans began to, not just collect information, but arrange and organize it effectively towards a single goal - To transform the environment that surrounded them and bend it to their will.

##### The Transformation of one’s environment

There is a pattern that manifests itself throughout human history as we sought to transform our environment. The Model-View-Controller. A horse drawn cart is replaced by a diesel engine because humans began to think of information related to the model (transportation systems) as separate from the view (horse or engine) and the controller (coachman or driver).

This is a very effective way to reason about and articulate problems that address specific concerns, without having to dream up a completely new idea. For example, incremental improvements can be done by improving the Controller. Innovation can be achieved by changing the View. And radical re-thinking can be achieved by changing the Model. 

Let’s get back to the horse and cart situation — better transportation time can be achieved by getting a better coachmen (controller); unthinkably better times can be achieved by replacing the horse with an engine (view); and entire societies are transformed with the ability to make a car appear by pressing two buttons in the palm of your hand. (the model).

### Using another example, this time from banking:

*    Improving the controller (logical & algorithmic efficiency) may result in a better transaction speeds; 
*    Improving the view will change the user experience (i.e. banking experience — branch to web to mobile);
*    Improving the model (i.e. crypto-currency) seeks to radically transform society.

Let us now use this image to understand how the digital world works, from a web development perspective.
