A handpicked compilation to the digital terms commonly used today.

---

# A

## Accessibility

Accessibility is the process of making web content accessible to people with disabilities such as
those who are visually impaired, hearing-impaired, colour blind people, or anyone else who cannot for whatever reason, use a computer in a conventional manner. A website with poor accessibility will be difficult for these people to use. Accessibility is particularly important for sites providing information to those with disabilities such as those in the healthcare sector and government departments. Accessibility is an important aspect to consider when designing any site. Guidelines for the various levels of accessibility are set by industry bodies, such as the W3C WAI.

---

## AJAX

Stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is typically used for creating dynamic web applications and allows for asynchronous data retrieval – content updating without the web page having to reload. The JavaScript on any given page handles most of the basic functions of the application, making it perform more like a desktop program instead of a web-based one. A good example of AJAX in action is Google Maps – which allows the visitor to scroll around a map without the browser refreshing.

---

## Anchor Text

Anchor text usually gives the user relevant descriptive or contextual information about the content of the link’s destination. The anchor text above in bold – what the visitor will see on a website.

---

## API (Application Programming Interface)

The way computer programs share data and functionality with other computer programs. APIs are an increasingly critical part of the Internet’s interconnection. Many say that the future of the Internet lies in APIs because they help distribute and combine content. On the Web, APIs are generally special URLs that give back machine-readable data, in formats like JSON or XML, rather than human-readable data, which is usually HTML. Facebook, Twitter and Google Maps all have APIs that allow other websites or computer programs to use their underlying tools. The New York Times and NPR have also released APIs that allow other programs to draw on archives of movie reviews, restaurant reviews and articles.

---

## Android

Usually used in the context of Android phone, Android is a free and open source operating system developed by Google that powers a variety of mobile phones from different manufacturers and carriers. It is a rival of the iPhone platform. In contrast to Apple’s tightly controlled architecture and App Store, Android allows users to install apps from the Android Market and from other channels, such as directly from a developer’s website — which allows for X-rated content, for example. Some well-known Android phones are the Nexus One, the Motorola Droid and HTC Evo. Expect to see competitors to the iPad running a version of Android.

---

## App

Short for application, a program that runs inside another service. Many mobile phones allow apps to be downloaded, leading to a burgeoning economy for modestly priced software. Can also refer to a program or tool that can be used within a website. Apps generally are built using software toolkits provided by the underlying service, whether it is iPhone or Facebook.

---

## Algorithm

A set of instructions or procedures used in order to accomplish a task, such as creating search
results in Google. In the context of search, algorithms are used to provide the most relevant results first based on those instructions.

---

## Atom

A syndication format for machine-readable web feeds that is usually accessible via a URL. While it was created as an alternative to RSS (Real Simple Syndication) to improve upon RSS’s deficiencies (such as ambiguities), it still is secondary to RSS. (See also, RSS)

---

## AMA

Ask me anything. A style of Reddit post, in which the poster opens themselves up to questions and answers them in the comments, usually done in real-time.

---

## Analytics

Measuring, analysing and interpreting activity and interactions on and across social media
platforms. It is a powerful tool for marketers, enabling them to see how they are performing against Social Media Objectives and where they can improve.

---

## Avatar

A picture or a graphic that represents you or your company online. Also commonly known as a
Profile Picture.

---

## ATL

Above the line ads include any which focus on general media such as TV, cinema, radio, print and the Internet.

---

## Audience segment

A group of users with similar traits or characteristics.

---

## Audience targeting

Targeting of specific audience segments, such as an age demographic. Audience segments can be defined in OpenX or in an external data management platform (DMP).

---

## Audit trail

Logging of any changes to data (creation, modification, or deletion) to allow a system admin user to review all historical changes.

---

# B
## Back End

The back end of a website is the part hidden from view of regular website visitors. The back end generally includes the information structure, applications, and the CMS controlling content on the site.

---

## Backlink

Backlinks are links from other websites back to yours. They are sometimes also referred to as
“trackbacks” (especially on blogs). Backlinks have a huge impact on your sites search rankings. Lots of backlinks from high-ranking sites can greatly improve your search engine results, especially if those links use keywords in their anchor text.

---

## Bad Neighbourhood

A “bad neighbourhood” refers to the server where your site is hosted. A site hosted on a server that hosts other sites that spam or use black-hat SEO practices can end up penalised by search engines solely because of their proximity to those sites. Linking to sites in bad neighbourhoods can also have a negative effect on your search rankings.

---

## Bandwidth

Bandwidth can refer to two different things: the rate at which data can be transferred, or the total amount of data allowed to be transferred from a web host during a given month (or other hosting service term) before overage charges are applied. It is generally referred to in term of bits-per-second (bps), kilobits per second (kbs), or other metric measurements. Lower bandwidth internet connections such as dial-up mean data loads slower than with high bandwidth connections such as broadband.

---

## Below the Fold

This term is a carry-over from newspaper publishing days. In newspaper terms, “below the fold” means content was on the bottom half of the page below the physical fold in the paper. In web design terms, “below the fold” refers to the content that is going to appear off of the bottom of the screen for the average website visitor in their browser.

---

## Bounce Rate

Website bounce rate is the number, or percentage of people who leave the site from the same page they entered, without clicking through to any other pages. This can be a good indicator of how good the navigation on the website is, as well as an indicator of the quality of the content on the website. Generally, a high bounce rate indicates a poor page design.

---

## Breadcrumb

Breadcrumbs are the navigational elements that generally appear near the top of a given web page that show you the pages and subpages that appear before the page you’re on. For example, on a blog, the breadcrumb might look something like: Home > Category > Year > Month > Post, or maybe a lot simpler. The term ‘breadcrumb’ comes from the fairy tale “Hansel and Gretel.”

---

## Browser

Browser refers to the program a website visitor is using to view the website. Examples include
Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

---

## Blog

A personal or company website or web page on which an individual or group of individuals post informal articles, record opinions or share links, videos or imagery, on a regular basis.

---

## Blogger Outreach

The process by which you ‘reach out’ to other bloggers within your industry or category. Blogger outreach involves contacting individual bloggers and asking them if they are interested in either hosting content you’ve created for them or in writing content and mentioning or linking to your website or brand.

---

## Bloggersphere or Blogosphere

A term to refer to all known blogs on the internet and their interconnections.

---

## Banner

This is an ad that appears on a web page which is typically hyperlinked to an advertiser’s website. Banners can be images (GIF, JPEG, PNG), JavaScript programs or multimedia objects (Flash, Java, Shockwave etc.).

---

# C
## Call to Action

A specific action or request that you hope a person will take, such as “”Call For a Free Consultation

---

## Cache/Caching

Cached files are those that are saved or copied (downloaded) by a web browser so that the next time that user visits the site, the page loads faster.

---

## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Also referred to simply as CSS, Cascading Style Sheets are used to define the look and feel of a website outside of the actual HTML of the site. In recent years, CSS has replaced tables and other HTML-based methods for formatting and laying out websites. The benefits of using CSS are many, but some of the most important are the simplification of a site’s HTML files, which can actually increase search engine rankings and the ability to completely change the style of a site by changing just one file without having to make changes to content. The latest version is CSS3.

---

## CGI

The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol for interfacing external application software with an information server, commonly a web server. CGI usually comes in the form of a script, which is called to perform a particular function on a website. CGI scripts are usually written in a programming language called PERL

---

## Client-Side

Client-side refers to scripts that are run in a visitor’s browser, instead of on a web server – as in server-side scripts. Client-side scripts are generally faster to interact with, though they can take longer to load initially.

---

## civic media

An umbrella term describing media technologies that create a strong sense of engagement among residents through news and information. It is often used as a contrast to “citizen journalism” because it also encompasses mapping, wikis, and databases. MIT has a Center for Future Civic Media.

---

## cloud computing

An increasingly popular computing model in which information and software are provided on
demand from over the Internet rather than staying on local computers. Cloud computing is
appealing because companies can reduce the amount they spend on their own computer servers and software but can also quickly and easily expand as the company grows. Examples of cloud computing applications include Google Docs and Yahoo Mail. Amazon offers two cloud computing services: EC2, which many start-ups now use as a cheap way to launch their products, and S3, an online storage system many companies use for cheap storage.

---

## Content Management System (CMS)

Also known as a CMS, the Content Management System is a backend tool for managing the content of a website. The CMS separates the core content (text, images, video) from the design and functionality of the site. Using a CMS generally, makes it easier to change the design or function of a site independently of the website content. It will often make it easier for administrators who aren’t web developers, to add content to a website.

---

## Comment

In web design terms, a comment is a bit of information contained in the HTML or XHTML of a web page, which is ignored by the browser. Comments are used to identify different parts of the file and as reference notes. Good commenting makes it much easier for a web designer to make changes to the site, as it clearly defines which parts of the code perform what functions. There are different comment formats for different programming and markup languages.

---

## CPA (Cost Per Action)

A pricing model in which the advertiser is charged for an ad based on how many users take a
specific, pre-defined action–such as buying a product from an online store–based on viewing an ad. This is the “gold standard” for advertisers because it most directly matches the cost of an ad to its effectiveness. However, it’s not commonly used since it’s extremely difficult to measure: it is often unclear when or how to attribute an action to a specific ad. (Also sometimes referred to as Cost Per Acquisition.)

---

## CPC (Cost Per Click)

A pricing model in which the advertiser is charged for an ad based on how many users click it. This is a common model for “search advertising” (the all-text ads associated with search results) and with text ads in general. CPC is well-suited for “directed” advertising, intended to prompt an immediate response because a user’s clicking on an ad shows engagement with it. Google AdWords is generally priced on a CPC basis.

---

## CPM (Cost Per Mille)

Cost per one thousand (often views). Much of online advertising — particularly display advertising — is priced on a CPM basis. (Mille = Latin for one thousand; we use “K” for “kilo” almost everywhere else in tech, but “M” for “mille” here, which causes some confusion.) CPM is well suited for “brand” or “awareness” advertising, in which the primary purpose of the ad is not necessarily to prompt an immediate response.

---

## Creative Commons

A flexible set of copyright licenses that allow content creators to specify which rights they reserve and which they waive regarding their work that is supposed to codify collaborative spirit of the Internet. There are six main Creative Commons licenses based on four conditions that creators can choose to apply: Attribution, Share Alike, Non-Commercial, and No Derivative Works. The least restrictive of the licenses is Attribution, which grants anyone, from an individual to a large company, the right to distribute, display, or otherwise make use of the work so long as the creator is credited. The most restrictive is Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives, which grants only redistribution. First released in December 2002 by the nonprofit Creative Commons organization, which was inspired by the open source GNU GPL license, the licenses are now used on an estimated 130 million works worldwide. The glossary you are reading is released under a Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license in an effort to encourage wide distribution and contribution. (Also see open source)

---

## Cloud Computing

A type of computing where resources are retrieved from the internet through web-based tools and applications, rather than being stored on local servers.

---

## Community Manager

Responsible for building, growing and managing online communities around a brand, cause or topic.

---

## Content Marketing

A marketing technique of creating and distributing relevant and valuable online content to attract, acquire, and engage a clearly defined target audience.

---

## Content Strategy

The planning and development for the creation, delivery, and governance of online, shareable content. A content strategy should outline what social channels to use, what types of content are to be shared via what channels, and a schedule of content production.

---

## Conversion

A conversion is the completion of a goal by an end user of a website – having gone through a series of steps to reach that goal. A goal can be defined as anything, ranging from the user completing a registration form or survey, downloading a file or purchasing something. Conversion rate is a good measure of the performance of a website and will often be the benchmark used when trying to improve the efficiency of a website.

---

## CSS Framework

A CSS framework is a collection of CSS files used as the starting point to make XHTML and CSS websites quickly and painlessly. They usually contain CSS styles for typography and layout.

---

## CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

An extremely simple data format which stores information in a text file. CSV is popular precisely because it can be easily read by many different applications, including spreadsheets, word processors, programming text editors and web browsers. Thus it is a common way for people, including governments, to make their data available. Each row of data is represented by a line of text. Each column is delimited/separated by a comma (,). To prevent confusion about commas in the data, the terms are often surrounded by double quotes (“). Many applications support the use of alternative column delimiters (the pipe character, |, is popular). Example below:
“Name”,”Address”,”email”
“Jack”,”1 Main St., Town, NY”,”jack@hill.com”
“Jill”,”2 Elm St., City, CA”,jill@hill.com

---

# D
## Data visualization

A growing area of content creation in which information is represented graphically and often
interactively. This can be used for subjects as diverse as an analysis of a speech by the president and the popularity of baby names over time. While it has deep roots in academia, data visualization has begun to emerge on content sites as a way to handle the masses of data that are being made public, often by government. There are many tools for data visualizations, including Seattle-based Tableau and IBM’s Many Eyes. Data visualization should 1) tell a story, 2) allow users to ask their own questions and 3) start conversations.

---

## Document-oriented database

An increasingly popular type of database. In contrast to relational databases, which rigidly require information to be stored in pre-defined tables, document-oriented databases are more free-flowing and flexible. This is important when you don’t know what is going to be thrown at you. Documentoriented databases retrieve information more quickly but store it less efficiently. The same document-oriented database might let you store the information for an article (headline, byline, data, content, miscellaneous) or for a photo (file, photographer, date, cutline). MongoDB is a popular open source document-oriented database.

---

## Drupal

A popular content management system known for a vibrant open-source community that creates diverse and robust extensions. Drupal is very powerful, but it is somewhat difficult to use for simple tasks when compared to WordPress. Drupal provides options to create a static website, a multiuser blog, an Internet forum or a community website for user-generated content. It is written in PHP and distributed under the GPL open source license. Whitehouse.gov uses Drupal.

---

## Django

A web framework that is popular among news and information sites, in part due to its origin at Lawrence Journal-World in Kansas. It is written in Python, a sophisticated dynamic language. Major projects built in Django include Disqus, Everyblock.com and TheOnion.com. News applications teams, including those at the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, use the framework to present large data sets online in easily accessible ways.

---

## Deprecated

Deprecated code is code that is no longer included in the language specifications. Generally, this happens because it is replaced with more accessible or efficient alternatives. This happens when a new version of a programming language or framework is released.

---

## DHTML

Stands for Dynamic HyperText Markup Language. DHTML fuses XHTML (or any other markup language), the DOM, JavaScript (or other scripts), and CSS (or other presentation definition languages) to create interactive web content.

---

## DNS

Stands for ‘Domain Name Service’ or alternately ‘Domain Name System’, or ‘Domain Name Server’. The DNS converts IP addresses into domain names. DNS servers are provided with the IP address of your web server when you assign your domain name to those servers. In turn, when someone types your domain name into their web browser the DNS servers translate the domain name to the IP address and point the browser to the correct web server.

---

## Doctype

The doctype declaration specifies which version of HTML is used in a document. It has a direct effect on whether your HTML will validate or not.

---

## DOM, The

Stands for Document Object Model. It is a language-independent, cross-platform convention for representing objects in XML, XHTML, and HTML documents. Rules for interacting with and programming the DOM are specified in the DOM API.

---

## Domain

The domain is the name by which a website is identified. The domain is associated with an IP address. Domains can be purchased with any combination of letters, hyphens (-), and numbers (though it can’t start with a hyphen). Depending on the extension (.com, .net, .org, etc.), a domain can be anywhere up to 26 to 63 characters long.

---

## Domain Authority

This is a scale from 1-100 that search engines use to determine how authoritative a company’s website is, 1 being the lowest rank and 100 being the highest. The higher your domain authority the more Search Engines trust you.

---

## DTD

Stands for Document Type Definition. DTD is one of several SGML and XML schema languages. It provides a list of the attributes, comments, elements, entities, and notes in a document along with their relationships to each other.

---

# E
## Earned Media

Word of mouth mentions of your company, generated on a person to person basis EC2
A computing power rental system by Amazon that has become popular among technology
companies because it is much cheaper than maintaining your own computer servers. Users can host their applications on EC2 and pay depending on usage. EC2 is an example of cloud computing. (Also see cloud computing)

---

## E-Commerce

Short for Electronic Commerce, E-Commerce is the process of buying and selling of goods online through websites. Products sold through e-commerce can be physical products that require shipping, or digital products delivered electronically such as program and document downloads, license keys and music.

---

## Elastic Layout

An elastic layout is one that uses percentage and em for defining page width, paired with a max width style to allow the layout of the website to stretch when font sizes are changed. The ability to flex to accommodate the browser width and visitor’s font preferences is where the name ‘elastic’ comes from.

---

## Element

In XML, an element is the central building block of any document. Individual elements can contain text, other elements, or both.

---

## Em

Em is a unit of measurement for sizing fonts and other elements within a web page relative to the parent element of the item. A 1em font is equal to the point size for the font already defined in the parent element. For example, 2em would be twice the current size, .5em would be half the current size and so on.

---

## Embedded Style

An embedded style is a CSS style written into the head of an XHTML document. t only affects the elements on that page, instead of site-wide as a separate CSS file does. Style in an embedded style sheet will override styles from the linked CSS file.

---

## Engagement

Engagement or Social Engagement refers to the amount of participation in an online community. Retweets, comments, and Likes are all forms of social engagement.

---

## Ex

Ex is a measurement for font height or size relative to the height of a lowercase “x” in that font
family.

---

## Extensible Markup Language

Otherwise known as XML. XML is a markup language used for writing custom markup languages. In other words, XML describes how to write new languages. It is sometimes referred to as a “meta” language because of this. It also serves as a basic syntax that allows different kinds of computers and applications to share information without having to go through multiple conversion layers.

---

## External Style Sheet

This is CSS that is stored in an external document. The biggest advantage to using an external style sheet is that it can be linked to by multiple HTML/XHTML files, meaning that changes made to the style sheet will affect all the pages linked to it, rather than having to change each page individually.

---

## Event Tracking

The code on web pages that allows Google Analytics to track and measure events on web pages, such as clicks or downloads.

---

## Goal Tracking

The code on web pages that allows Google Analytics to track when certain tasks are completed, such as a download.

---

# F
## Facebook Connect

A technology from Facebook that allows a reader to log into a third-party website with their
Facebook account, rather than creating a new profile for that website. Facebook Connect, which is an API, also allows the third parties to pull certain data from the user’s profile, such as his or her name and age. In turn, the reader’s activities on the website can also be displayed on her or his Facebook profile. Launched in 2007, Facebook Connect was one of the first examples of Facebook extending itself into a platform for the entire Web. (Also see OAuth, Open ID)

---

## Facebook

Facebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live around them. People use Facebook to connect and share content with friends and associates. Facebook is now the largest social network on the internet, with more than 400 million active users, half of whom log on to Facebook in any given day. People spend over 500 billion minutes per month on Facebook

---

## Favicon

Favicons are tiny (generally 16×16 pixels, though some are 32×32 pixels), customizable icons
displayed in the web address bar in most browsers next to the web address. They’re either 8-bit or 24-bit in color depth and are saved in either .ico, .gif or .png file formats.

---

## Facebook fan page

A Facebook profile for a specific person, product, company or organization, usually administered by official representatives. This is different from a Facebook personal page, which must be owned by an individual, and different from a Facebook community page, which is built around an interest not related to a brand, such as “cooking.” It is also different from a Facebook group. Fan pages can gather thousands or millions of fans through “likes,” and official posts by the page administrator generally go into the fans’ news streams. Once a page has more than 25 fans, it can claim a short form URL, such as facebook.com/nytimes or facebook.com/wikileaks. Facebook community and fan pages are strong players in ongoing efforts to bring content to people where they already are, instead of requiring them to come to the content.

---

## Facebook group

Facebook groups are analogous to offline clubs. Unlike Facebook fan pages, groups do not have to be administered by official representatives. In addition, the activity posted in groups does not get pushed into users’ feeds. But as long as it has fewer than 5,000 members, Facebook groups are allowed to mass-message all their members.

---

## Facebook personal page

A profile page tied to a single individual. What information is controlled (in theory) by the individual. However, because there is a 5,000-person limit to friends, some celebrities have fan pages instead. As of 2009, individuals can choose a username, which makes their page available at facebook.com/username.

---

## Flash

A proprietary platform owned by Adobe Systems that allows for drag-and-drop animations, program interactivity, and dynamic displays for the Web. The language used, ActionScript, is owned by Adobe; this contrasts with many other popular programming languages that are open source. Creators must use Adobe’s Creative Suite products and web surfers must install a Flash plug-in for their browser. Many claim that Flash players are unstable and inefficient, slowing down web pages and crashing operating systems. Apple has not allowed Adobe to create a Flash player for the iPhone operating system, which has created a feud between the two companies. HTML5 is emerging as an open alternative to Flash.

---

## Framework

A software package that makes writing programs easier by providing all the “plumbing” for a
particular type of task (like writing a web app), allowing programmers to just “fill in the blanks” with their own project-specific needs. For instance, Web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails (written in Ruby, meaning programmers use Ruby to do the “fill in the blanks” tasks) and Django (written in Python), have easy-to-use, built-in support for common web development tasks, such as reading and writing to a database, writing content in html, and so forth. Watch Django and Ruby creators discuss the merits of their frameworks on DjangoProject.com.

---

## Facetime

A free video chat and VOIP software application developed by Apple to run on all devices running iOS, the Apple operating system found on iPhones, iPads, and computers.

---

## Flickr

An image and video hosting website popular with bloggers and owned by Yahoo!
Forums An online discussion site where registered users can hold conversations in the form of posted messages, or threads.

---

## Foursquare

Foursquare is a geo-social network where users can “check-in” to places they are visiting, leave tips, add reviews and post pictures. Geo-social works by combining a traditional social networking model of registered users who connect with one another, to GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) technology. By connecting these two models, users don’t just get updates, they also get information about where the updates were made.

---

## Fixed Width Layout

A fixed width web page layout has a set width, usually defined in pixels. The width stays the same regardless of screen resolution, monitor size, or browser window size. It allows for minute adjustments to be made to a design that will stay consistent across browsers. Designers have more control over exactly how a site will appear across platforms with this type of layout.

---

## Flash

Adobe Flash is a technology that enables websites to display vector-based animation. More recently, Flash has become a powerful tool for creating web-based applications. Files created in Flash can now be distributed as stand-alone desktop applications by using another technology – Adobe Air.

---

## Focal Point

The focal point of a website is the spot on a web page that the eye is naturally drawn to. This could be an image, a banner, text, Flash content, or just about anything else. It is important to ensure that the focal point is the most important part of the page.

---

## Font Family

A font family is a group designation for defining the typefaces used in CSS documents. The font family tag generally lists multiple fonts to be used, and usually ends with the generic font category such as “serif” or “sans-serif”.

---

## Font Style

In CSS, the font style refers solely to whether a font is italic or not.

---

## Font Weight

The font weight refers to how thick or thin (bold or light) a font looks.

---

## Front-End

The front-end is the opposite of the back-end. It is all the components of a website that a visitor to the site can physically see such as pages, images, and other content. More specifically, it is the interface that visitors use to access the website content. It is also sometimes referred to as the User Interface (UI).

---

# G
## Google

The World’s largest Internet search engine, indexing literally billions of web pages. In May 2010, 30.7m people in the UK searched on Google.

---

## Google Analytics

A Google tool used to measure data about your website’s performance.

---

## Google AdSense

Google’s online advertising network that allows content publishers to embed a piece of code to
display Google ads on their sites. The ads are selected based on the content of the page. Ad revenue is split between Google and the publisher in an undisclosed proportion, generally believed to be twothirds to the publisher. (Note: ads on Google’s own sites are covered by Google AdWords, not AdSense.)

---

## Google AdWords

Google’s text-based flagship advertising product, which provides the lion’s share of the company revenue. Ads are displayed on Google’s own sites based on search terms that users type in, and advertisers pay only when the users click on them. The search terms, called keywords, are purchased by advertisers; availability of a given keyword is based in part on an auction system, and in part on the responsiveness of the audience.

---

## Graceful Degradation

Graceful degradation refers to the ability for a website to have elements that may take advantage of the capabilities of newer browsers, but done in a way which allows users with older browsers to still view the site in a manner that at least allows them access to basic content. It also applies to making sure that if one small portion of your site does not work in someone’s browser, it does not cause the site to error or crash in their browser.

---

## Graphical User Interface

Also referred to by its acronym: GUI. A graphical user interface uses an input device such as a mouse and gives visual representations of how the user is able to interact with a web application. In other words, a GUI is all of the front-end stuff you see on a web application. The purpose of a GUI is to allow you to interact with a web application without having to enter code.

---

## Geolocation/Geotagging

Geolocation is the process of finding, determining and providing the exact location of a computer or networking device. It enables the use of a variety of location-based apps, such as Foursquare, Facebook, Google Maps, Urbanspoon and RunKeeper. It is being used by bricks and mortar shops, such as retail spaces and restaurants, to increase online/offline social engagement.

---

## Google+

A social network owned and operated by Google. Users can post stories, share videos and pictures, organise friends into circles, join communities and chat to other users. Your Google+ account syncs up with all other Google accounts you may have; Gmail, YouTube, etc. It is the second largest social networking site in the world, after Facebook.

---

## Google Authorship

A way of linking the content you create, on any website, with your Google+ profile. When you have correctly set-up Google Authorship, your profile picture will appear in Google search results beside any written content you publish online. As Google’s search algorithm favours content from thought leaders and experts, using Google Authorship is a way to boost your ranking.

---

## Google Hangouts

An instant messaging and video chat platform developed by Google, that works across all computers and both Android and Apple phones and tablets.

---

# H
## Hashtag

A word or unspaced phrase prefixed with the # symbol. Commonly used on social networking sites such as Twitter, Google+ and Instagram. Appending a hashtag to a post both helps to give that message context and groups it with other messages about that same topic or event.

---

## Hootsuite

A social media management platform that allows users and brand managers to update, post, schedule and respond via multiple social media platforms, including; for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, and WordPress. Hootsuite operates on a freemium model with products built for casual and enterprise users.

---

## Hexadecimal

Also referred to a “hex” numbers, they are a base-16 numbering system used to define colors
online. Hex numbers include the numerals 0-9 and letters A-F. Hexadecimal numbers are written in three sets of hex pairs. Because screen colours are Red, Green and Blue the first pair defines the Red hue, the second pair defines the Green hue, and the third pair defines the Blue.

---

## Hit

Contrary to popular belief, a hit does not represent a single visitor to a website. A hit is actually a request for a single file from your web server. This means one page can actually generate multiple hits, as each page generally has more than one file, for example a HTML or other base file, a CSS file, multiple images and so on. Each request for each file is one hit, so a web page with 50 images on would register 50 hits. Many years ago, hits were quoted as the main traffic metric, to amplify sites into sounding like they were receiving more traffic than they actually were.

## HTML

(Hypertext Markup Language) — The dominant formatting language used on the World Wide Web to publish text, images, and other elements. Invented by Tim Berners Lee in the early 1990s, HTML uses pairs of opening and closing tags (also known as elements), such as <title> and </title>; each pair assigns meaning to the text that appears between them. HTML can be considered code, but it is not a programming language; it’s a markup language, which is a separate beast. The latest standard of HTML is HTML5, which adds powerful interactive functionality.

---

## HTML5

The upcoming, powerful standard of Hypertext Markup Language, which has added advanced
interactive features, such as allowing video to be embedded on a web page. It is gaining in popularity compared to proprietary standards, like Adobe Flash, because it is an open standard and does not require third-party plugins. Using HTML5 will allow web pages to work more like desktop applications. The latest releases of most browsers support HTML5 to varying degrees. HTML5 does not cover CSS and JavaScript, but often when people refer to HTML5, they often are using it as a blanket term, applying not only to changes to the HTML but also to changes in CSS and JavaScript.
